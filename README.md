## 💼 Leadership & Philosophy

As an Engineering Manager, I believe that **great code is a byproduct of a great culture.** My approach centers on:

* **Design-Led Engineering:** Bringing my multimedia design background into the sprint cycle to ensure technical feasibility never sacrifices user delight.
* **Radical Candor & Mentorship:** Growing teams by providing high-challenge, high-support environments.
* **Product-Minded Development:** Empowering engineers to think like product owners—focusing on the *why* behind the feature, not just the *how*.

## 🎮 Beyond the IDE
When I’m not scaling products or mentoring, you’ll find me:

- **Fatherhood:** Navigating the most rewarding (and complex) "live build" yet—learning the ropes of being a dad.
- **Grilling:** Embracing the Texas lifestyle by perfecting the art of low-and-slow BBQ.
- **Biking:** Hitting the trails to disconnect, reset, and clear the mental cache.
- **Gaming:** Exploring immersive worlds and deconstructing game mechanics.
- **Designing:** Keeping my multimedia roots alive through high-fidelity brand and UI side-quests.
